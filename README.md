My name is Ricardo, i'm from Mexico, i like technology but, above all, 
i like the things related to software creation and cibersegurity.
My favorite things to do when i am not busy are playing drums, playing videogames
and staring at a wall while i'm listening rock and metal music.
i'm stilla student and i don't have any experience with programming and that things
so i hope i can learn lots of things that can be useful for software programming.
